In this project, I was provided with a Python code snippet implementing a Q-learning algorithm for training a model to navigate a maze environment. The given code included the qtrain function, which orchestrates the training process, and some utility functions for formatting time and checking completion. My task involved understanding and extending this code to incorporate additional functionalities and optimizations.

The provided code outlined the basic structure of the training loop, including environment setup, training iterations, experience replay, and progress tracking. It also included comments guiding the implementation of specific steps within the loop, such as agent movement and model training. However, some parts of the code were incomplete or required refinement, such as the implementation of epsilon-greedy exploration, action selection, and model training with experience replay.

To enhance the code, I added functionality for epsilon-greedy action selection, implemented the decay of epsilon over epochs for exploration-exploitation balance, and integrated model training using experience replay. Additionally, I refined the progress tracking mechanism to print informative updates during training and adjusted hyperparameters for better convergence and performance.

Connecting this project to the broader field of computer science, it highlights the interdisciplinary nature of reinforcement learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence. Computer scientists engage in various activities, including designing algorithms, developing software systems, analyzing data, and solving complex problems across domains. Through this project, I applied concepts from machine learning, algorithm design, and software engineering to develop an intelligent agent capable of learning optimal behavior in a dynamic environment.

As a computer scientist, approaching a problem involves breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks, identifying relevant concepts and techniques, and iteratively refining solutions based on feedback and experimentation. This iterative and systematic approach allows for the exploration of multiple strategies and the selection of the most effective ones.

Ethically, computer scientists have responsibilities to both end users and organizations. When designing and implementing software systems, considerations for user privacy, security, accessibility, and fairness must be prioritized. Additionally, transparency and accountability in algorithmic decision-making are essential to mitigate potential biases and ensure equitable outcomes for all stakeholders. By upholding ethical principles and values, computer scientists contribute to the development of technology that positively impacts society while minimizing potential harms.
